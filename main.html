<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
 <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time required to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. A program with a lower time complexity is more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory (space) taken by an algorithm to run. A program with a space complexity of O(n) means the amount of memory it needs to run is directly proportional to the input size.</p>
